# Backend for Angular example

This backend retrieves data from a postgres database as well as from a file on the server and exposes the data via REST api endpoints.

The corresponding front end can be found here:

## Load dependencies

```
yarn
```

## Start the application

```
yarn dev
```

## Usage

This backend doesn't need any further interaction. It should be consumable from the frontend as soon as it is started.
